# Vision

The app itself is a Todo app which tells the user which task they should be doing next, at first the app will show random tasks, then in future AI can be implemented, however in this unit the main part will be the android Design and functionality part.

The user will be able to save and load different Todo lists from their local storage. The app will use different UI elements to show user what they have forgotten and what they can do, they can have different tasks in one list, thatâ€™s the idea.


# Feedback

The app could've been more real time and more progress bars should be used when the user is logging in or when the lists are being loaded from the internet.
